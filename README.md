# PDSLABPROJECT
+ This is a scientific calculator which contains normal Computational,Vector,Complex and Matrix calculator.
## In Computational calculator:
   + The operations possible are addition,subtraction,multiplication and division where huge calculations involving even brackets can be done.
   + BODMAS rule is followed.
   + If we give any invalid charecters or unequal number of paranthesis or we leave decimal without a following digit,The output is printed as "SYNTAX ERROR"
## In Vector calculator:
   +  The user should provide the x,y,z components of a vector then he can choose whether he wants to give input for 2nd vector.
   +  If user doesnt want to continue,the magnitude of the vector gets printed.
   +  If user wants to give the input for 2nd vector,then the user gets provided by these operations to perform between these 2 vectors:
    + Dot product
    + Cross product
    + Addition
    + Subtraction
   +  After that, the user gets to update the 2nd vector and would be provided the same operations mentioned above to perform with the 1st vector.
## In Complex calculator:
  +  The user should provide the real and imaginary parts of a complex number then he can choose whether he wants to give the input of 2nd complex number.
  +  If user doesnt want to continue,the polar form and the conjugate of the complex number gets  printed.
  +   If the user wants to give the input of 2nd complex number,then the user gets provided by these operations to perform between these 2 complex numbers:
    + Addition
    + Subtraction
    + Multiplication
    + Division
  +   After that, the user gets to update the 2nd complex number and would be provided the same operations mentioned above to perform with the 1st complex number.
## In Matrix calculator
 +    The user is first asked to enter the dimensions of the 1st matrix and then the elements of the matrix
 +    Then the user can choose whether he wants to give input for 2nd matrix or not
 +    If the user doesnt want to continue for 2nd matrix,then the inverse matrix and the determinant of the first matrix gets printed
 +    If the user wants to continue,then the user gets provided by these following operations to perform between these 2 matrices:
   +  Addition
   +  Subtraction
   +  Multiplication
 +    (To calculate determinant of the matrix, a function to find cofactors is also included)
+ In each of these modes( Vector,computational ,matrix and complex), the user is provided EXIT MODE option to get out of that mode and return to main menu.
